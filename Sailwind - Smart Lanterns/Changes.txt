Changes:
v0.0.2
* Stop refilling oil lanterns with candles
* Added setting to choose which kind of lanterns should be controlled (oil, candle)
* Only try to change the lantern state once when a turn on/off time passed. This allows manual changes until next scheduled time.
* Removed a debug flag that was causing a log file to be created and quickly increase in size on the desktop.
* Only controls lanterns that are hanging on hooks
